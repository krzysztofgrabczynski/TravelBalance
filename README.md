## Description
TravelBalance is a comprehensive mobile application designed for managing your travel expenses, available for both iOS and Android platforms. It provides features like adding trips, where you can choose a photo from a default images and optionally choose the countries you're visiting. Within each trip, you can log expenses in any currency, and the app will automatically convert them into your selected base currency (you can set base currency in main settings of the application). The app generates detailed visual statistics, including graph showing how much you've spent on different categories during each trip. On the main screen, you can view overall statistics, including the number of trips you've taken, the countries you've visited, and your total spending in your base currency. Additionally, TravelBalance offers a Pro version, which removes advertisements and provides an enhanced, ad-free experience.

The design of the application was created using Figma, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. The frontend was developed by https://github.com/BartlomiejGajdur using Flutter, providing a smooth and responsive interface across both iOS and Android devices. The backend was built by me using the Django Rest Framework, ensuring secure and efficient handling of data. I also developed the <i><a href="https://www.travelbalance.pl">official website</a></i> for the app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and took care of the server set up on a virtual machine. 

To enhance user convenience, the app uses TokenAuthentication and social-oauth2, allowing users to register and log in seamlessly with their Google or Apple ID accounts.

## Trip management
Adding/Editing/Deleting a Trip:
Users can create a new trip by providing a name, selecting one of the available default images, and adding the countries they plan to visit. Users can then edit a trip by clicking the edit icon in the top-right corner of the trip view. There are also two ways to delete a specific trip: either during the editing process or by simply swiping left on the trip in the main screen for quick deletion.

## Expense management
Adding/Editing/Deleting an Expense:
Users can add an expense to a trip by providing details such as the name, amount, currency, and category. Every expense can be edited by tapping on it in the expense list. Users can delete an expense in two ways: either during the editing process or by swiping left on the expense in the list for quick deletion.

Note: The value of each expense is displayed in the currency it was originally added in. However, for the total trip expenses, each expense is automatically converted to the base currency, which can be configured by the user in the application settings.

## Set base currency
In the main settings of the application, users can set their **base currency**. All expenses will be automatically converted to this base currency. This allows users to see the total cost of each trip on the main screen in their chosen base currency, providing a more convenient and consistent view for better user experience. User can change the **base currency** at any time.
